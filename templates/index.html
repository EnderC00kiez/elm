<h1>This is your Elm server.</h1>
<title>Elm</title>
<a href="/returnerror/418">Test your error page here.</a>
<p>This file is templates/index.html. Modify it to modify the main page, or add a new file to serve that as /filename (without path). error.html allows you to customize the error page. settings.json in the root directory allows you to customize diffrent aspects of the website, such as HTTP headers. Duplicate filenames with diffrent extensions result in a 422 Unprocessable Entity error. CSS and JS go in the static folder, being served as static/filename. The server uses Jinja as the default templating engine.</p>
